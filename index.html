        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Dried fruit has been available for thousands of years in the Mediterranean and Middle East.<br>Dried fruit is made by taking the water out of the fruit by sun drying or using a special machine called a dehydrator.<br> Since the water is removed during drying, this also means that the natural sugars in the fruit are concentrated.</p>
